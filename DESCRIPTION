Description: SoundexBR returns a census-like phonetic code of a string name given the Portuguese sound system. This function was outlined to work with the \code{RecordLinkage} package, however, it is also helpful as a standalone function as it can help on identifying similar names based on a distribution of characters distance. See details bellow.
